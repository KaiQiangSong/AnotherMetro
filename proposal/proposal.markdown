# Proposal

1. Static background, the game is not infinite.
2. Initial 3 stations: SQR, CIRC, TRI
3. Distances between stations have lower bounds
4. Stations randomly emerge inside a bounding square at center which slowly grows outwards.
5. Ratio among common stations (SQR, CIRC, TRI) are preset.
6. Special stations available (star, diamond, etc.)
7. Fixed river.
8. Limited tunnels.
9. New stations automatically attach to existing routes if too close.
10. Passengers are generated uniformly among stations in increasing large waves, with weighted random targets.
11. Routes are only allowed to extend.  Changing or removing is not allowed.
12. Locomotives, carriages, interchanges won't be implemented.
13. Lines and tunnels are given weekly/monthly/whatever.
14. Route building algorithm and criteria are identical to MiniMetro.
15. Tunnel building algorithm and criteria are identical to MiniMetro.
16. Route intersections are allowed.
17. Passenger interchanges algorithm identical to MiniMetro.
18. Passengers magically onboard/offboard at the same time.
